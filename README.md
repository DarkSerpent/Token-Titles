# Token Titles
> Adds an optional Title to appear above a character token on the canvas map, which can be set in the Prototype Token settings.

## Additional Notes
* Setup is simple. Install the module onto your Foundry World and then navigate to the Prototype Token settings. If the token is already on the canvas map, remove it and replace it.
* It only works on scale 1:1 tokens and height/width 1x1 tokens for now, although it should work on all grid sizes.
